# Practice-Questions

A comprehensive collection of programming solutions, algorithms, and patterns for junior developer roles, organized by topic and programming language.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

### Programming Language Folders
- **Python/** - Python solutions for basic programming problems
- **Java/** - Java solutions for basic programming problems
- **C/** - C solutions for basic programming problems

### Topic-Based Folders
- **Patterns/** - Pattern printing programs (12+ patterns)
