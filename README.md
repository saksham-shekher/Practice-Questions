# Practice-Questions

A collection of basic programming solutions for junior developer roles, organized by programming language.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains practice questions and solutions in three programming languages:

- **Python/** - Python solutions
- **Java/** - Java solutions  
- **C/** - C solutions

Each folder contains solutions with multiple implementation methods to help you understand different approaches to solving the same problem.

## 🎯 Available Practice Questions

### Palindrome Checker

A comprehensive palindrome checking solution available in all three languages with multiple implementation methods:

- **String Reversal Method** - Reverse the string and compare
- **Two Pointer Method** - Efficient O(1) space complexity approach
- **Recursive Method** - Understanding recursion
- **Additional Methods** - Language-specific implementations

#### Quick Start:

**Python:**
```bash
cd Python
python palindrome.py
```

**Java:**
```bash
cd Java
javac Palindrome.java
java Palindrome
```

**C:**
```bash
cd C
gcc palindrome.c -o palindrome
./palindrome
```
