8. **Bug Fixes** - Fix issues in existing code

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

#### General Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-commented code
- **Multiple Methods**: For each problem, provide at least 2-3 different implementation approaches
- **Complexity Analysis**: Include time and space complexity in comments
- **Testing**: Ensure your code runs without errors and produces correct output
- **Documentation**: Add clear docstrings/comments explaining what each method does

#### Language-Specific Style Guides

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Example:
  ```python
  def function_name(param: int) -> int:
      """
      Brief description of what the function does.
      
      Time Complexity: O(n)
      Space Complexity: O(1)
      """
      # Implementation
  ```

**Java:**
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Add Javadoc comments
- Use meaningful class and method names
- Example:
  ```java
  /**
   * Brief description of what the method does.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   */
  public static int methodName(int param) {
      // Implementation
  }
  ```

**C:**
- Follow K&R or GNU style
- Add function comments
- Use meaningful variable names
- Free allocated memory properly
- Example:
  ```c
  /**
   * Brief description of what the function does.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   */
  int function_name(int param) {
      // Implementation
  }
  ```

### File Structure

When adding new problems, follow this structure:

```
Language-Folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem_name.ext          # Main implementation file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Update with new problem info
```

For patterns or algorithms:
```
Topic-Folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation.ext        # Add to existing file or create new
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Update with new addition
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Python files**: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `reverse_string.py`)
- **Java files**: `PascalCase.java` (e.g., `ReverseString.java`)
- **C files**: `snake_case.c` (e.g., `reverse_string.c`)
- **Functions/Methods**: Descriptive names that explain what they do

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Practice-Questions.git
   cd Practice-Questions
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-reverse-string`
- `fix/palindrome-bug`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

1. **Add your code** following the guidelines above
2. **Test your code** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Python
   python your_file.py
   
   # Java
   javac YourFile.java
   java YourFile
   
   # C
   gcc your_file.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
3. **Update documentation** if you're adding new problems or features
4. **Verify formatting** and style

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

Write clear, concise commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add reverse string problem with 3 methods"
```

**Good commit messages:**
- `Add bubble sort implementation in Python`
- `Fix off-by-one error in binary search`
- `Update README with new pattern examples`

**Bad commit messages:**
- `Update`
- `Fix bug`
- `Changes`

### Step 5: Push and Create Pull Request

1. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
