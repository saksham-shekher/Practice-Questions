# Pattern Printing Programs

This folder contains pattern printing programs commonly asked in junior developer coding interviews.

## Available in Languages

- **Python** - `patterns.py`
- **Java** - `Patterns.java`
- **C** - `patterns.c`

## Patterns Included

### 1. Square Pattern
A simple n√ón square filled with stars.

### 2. Right-Angled Triangle
Stars forming a right-angled triangle pattern.

### 3. Inverted Right-Angled Triangle
Inverted version of right-angled triangle.

### 4. Pyramid
Centered pyramid pattern with increasing rows.

### 5. Inverted Pyramid
Upside-down pyramid pattern.

### 6. Diamond
Complete diamond shape combining pyramid patterns.

### 7. Hollow Square
Square with stars only on borders.

### 8. Number Pattern
Right triangle filled with sequential numbers.

### 9. Number Pyramid
Pyramid where each row contains the same number.

### 10. Floyd's Triangle
Triangle filled with consecutive natural numbers.

### 11. Pascal's Triangle
Classic Pascal's triangle with binomial coefficients.

### 12. Alphabet Pattern
Triangle filled with alphabets (A, B, C, ...).

## Running the Code

### Python
```bash
python patterns.py
```

### Java
```bash
javac Patterns.java
java Patterns
```

### C
```bash
gcc patterns.c -o patterns
./patterns
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding nested loops
- Loop control and iteration patterns
- Space and character manipulation
- Problem-solving skills
- Pattern recognition

## Tips for Junior Developers

1. Start with simple patterns (square, triangle)
2. Understand the relationship between row number and elements
3. Practice calculating spaces and symbols for each row
4. Draw the pattern on paper first to understand the logic
5. Break down complex patterns into simpler components

## Common Use Cases in Interviews

Pattern printing questions test your understanding of:
- Nested loops
- Mathematical relationships
- Edge case handling
- Code organization
- Clean and readable code

These are fundamental skills required for any programming role!
